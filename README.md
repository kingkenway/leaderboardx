# Leaderboardx is a feature request system, where users of a particular company can request for new features and upvote existing features.
Also, existing companies will be able to move requests from In Active, to In Progress, and finally to Is Completed, thereby answering to the government of the users, for the users and by the users :)

Status: Still in progress, but you can check what I have been up to.
